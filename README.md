# Discord-Bot-Template
A Discord Bot Template written in C# on .Net Core 3.1

Run the Code and you should get a Directory called "Resources" in your debug folder.
Create a json-file called "config.json" and copy this code into it:

{

"token": "Your Token",

"cmdPrefix": "Your Prefix"

}

token will be your Discord bot Token which you can create on https://discord.com/developers.
cmdPrefix will be the prefix you want your Bot to have (! or ? or something).

Check if your Bot is on your Server. If so, run the Bot and it should connect.
